                <p>Semantic HTML is the correct use of HTML to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than merely define its appearance. Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content</p>

                <p>The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is. That clarity is also communicated with search engines, ensuring that the right pages are delivered for the right queries.</p>
